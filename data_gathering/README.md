# Data Gathering
This folder contains files we used to gather data to be processed by the ML system. The main components are:
 1) Robot Controller
 2) Battery Poller
 3) V/I draw monitor
 4) Navigation/Movement Monitor

## TODO's
  + add links to readme
  + do the nav monitor / set up a schema
  + integrate all code segments into one
    + make them all improtable and create a dataGather.py script
